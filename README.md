# Animatronito-FW

The firmware for the Animatronito

The minimum viable functionality:
	Let's assume a simple SD card layout
	at root a file called playlist.txt.
	For each entry in playlist a
	.wav file and a .ani file
	
	So with that the basic function is to
	configure the hardware
	read the playlist
	open the first .wav and .ani
	begin playing the .wav
	begin playing the .ani
	
	TODO: Write wrapper for PCA9685
